        "## 🤖 Agentic Workflow Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The user workflow is translated into an agentic system through the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **State Management**\n",
        "   - **Conversation State**: Tracks user queries, system responses, and context\n",
        "   - **Search State**: Maintains information about current search results and sources\n",
        "   - **Decision State**: Stores routing decisions and their rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Agent Components**\n",
        "   - **Router Agent**: Makes intelligent decisions about information sources\n",
        "     - Analyzes query type and context\n",
        "     - Determines optimal search strategy\n",
        "     - Handles fallback mechanisms\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Search Agent**: Executes information retrieval\n",

        "     - Generates coherent responses\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feedback Loop**\n",
        "   - System learns from user interactions\n",
        "   - Improves routing decisions over time\n",
        "   - Adapts to user preferences and query patterns\n",
